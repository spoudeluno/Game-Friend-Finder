            Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, 
            for Microsoft Windows. Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a 
            closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. 
            The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike 
            series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, 
            and inaccuracy while moving. Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games,

                Pretty fun game. Never really got into CS but playing Valorant has introduced me to FPS 5v5 and I've been digging it. Its hard to choose a main, but once you understand their abilities and when to use them, its insanely fun to play with your main. I main jett and the mechanics are really fun. Overall, movement is very smooth, guns are relatively leveled, and patches are always a good equalizer to a meta or bug. Also, the new addition of Chamber gave people who preferred to stay mid or heaven and pick off people a great agent, and the brand new Neon gives people an amazing fast push with all the abilities to block off a counter when their team pushes. New additions are constantly being added which keeps the game fresh and entertaining.

                Valorant has the same great gunplay as CS, but with mechanics that make it so that the game never gets stale. This game succeeds in certain areas that CS did not, and introduces smaller mechanics that CS should've had from the get go, for example, the selling system, requesting system, and the pinging system. The different characters introduce a new level of teamplay, with characters that can use their abilities in ways that synergize with others, allowing for great plays to be made. Another big factor about this game is the fact that it can run on potato pcs. a low end pc can run this game smoothly, with little to no problems appearing. Unlike valve, Riot actually listens to their community, and with every patch the game gets better and better. I personally found CS:GO to get stale after a while, so this game was a breath of fresh air for me and my friends. I totally suggest this game to anyone who is interested. GIVE IT A SHOT!

Actually, that's what I think about Valorant.... toxic nuclear waste. It takes elements from CSGO which is full of bots and cheaters anyway for people who want to feel like God and elements from Overwatch and *vomits* League of Legends . In my gaming history, Valorant ends up in the trash pile. CSGO is already in my trash pile anyway.

Despite being Free, it won't be free if you spend all your money on skins, aka microtransactions. A $60 dollar game is superior to a game that is free that you end up spending more then $100 on skins anyway. Don't be fooled by it marketing as F2P. The game just looks extraordinarily bland unless you try out gun-skins, and I am just not willing to go down that road.
